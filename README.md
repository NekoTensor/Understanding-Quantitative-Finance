# [Understanding Quantitative Finance](https://quantgirluk.github.io/Understanding-Quantitative-Finance/intro.html)

This is a collection of notes exploring a number of topics in Quantitative Finance (QF). The idea is to use Python 🐍to illustrate the theoretical concepts and help you to get a better understanding of each topic.

My aim is to provide an open-source repository where people interested in a career in QF can find these concepts covered in a rigorous manner while keeping the practitioners point of view into consideration.
